            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Thailand the land of the Tai People. The meaning of "tai" is uncertain, but may originally have meant "human beings," "people," or <em>free people</em>." In the mid-13th century two unified Thai kingdoms emerged the Sukhothai Kingdom, located in the south-central plains and the The Thai Lan Na Kingdom was established in the north with its capital at Chang Mai. The Ayutthaya Kingdom (14th-18th centuries) succeeded the Sukhothai and would become known as the Siamese Kingdom. Western pressure in the 1890s and 1900s led to Siam signing trade treaties that reduced the countrys sovereignty and independence.  </p>

            <p>Following a <em>bloodless</em> revolution in 1932 that led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy, Thailand's political history was marked by a series of mostly bloodless coups with power concentrated among military and bureaucratic elites. Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 </p>

            <p>In the 21st century, Thailand has experienced additional turmoil, including a military coup in 2006 The military-affiliated National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) ruled the country under PRAYUT for more than four years, drafting a new constitution that allowed the military to appoint the entire 250-member Senate and required a joint meeting of the House and Senate to select the prime minister -- which effectively gave the military a veto on the selection. The reformist Move Forward Party won the most seats in the 2023 election but was unable to form a government, and Srettha THRAVISIN from the Pheu Thai Party replaced PRAYUT as prime minister after forming a coalition of moderate and conservative parties.</p>
